Morpheus: What is it, Niobe?
Niobe: I can't help it, Morpheus, I can't help thinking - what if you're wrong. What if all this - the prophecy, everything - is bullshit.
 
Morpheus: Then tomorrow we may all be dead, but how would that be different from any other day? This is a war, and we are soldiers. Death can come for us at any time, in any place.

Axel: Incoming. Incoming! Incoming!.

Morpheus: Now consider the alternative. What if I am right? What if the prophecy is true? What if tomorrow the war could be over. Isn't that worth fighting for? Isn't that worth dying for?
