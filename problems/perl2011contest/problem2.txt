== Sum of cubes

Some natural numbers can be as the sum of two positive cubes of natural
numbers. For example, 1729 is 12 cubed plus 1 cubed. Some natural numbers
can even be expressed as more than one such sum. For example, 1729 can
also be expressed as 10 cubed plus 9 cubed.

Just for clarity's sake, the sum with the two terms reversed is the
same sum, not a new one. Thus, 91 is 3 cubed plus 4 cubed, but
finding "4 cubed plus 3 cubed" does not count as a distinct sum.

Write a program that accepts an integer N on the command line, and
prints out the first N of these numbers in increasing order. For each
number found, print it out, as well as the sums of cubes that yield that
number.

For example:

    1729 = 12 ** 3 + 1 ** 3 = 10 ** 3 + 9 ** 3
