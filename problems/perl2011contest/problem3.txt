== Addition chains

For a positive integer N, an addition chain for N is a sequence
starting with 1, each subsequent element being the sum of two
earlier elements (possibly the sum of the same element twice),
        and ending with N.

        For example for N = 9, this is a possible addition chain:

            (1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9)

  because 2 = 1 + 1, 4 = 2 + 2, 5 = 1 + 4, etc.

  But a minimal solution would be:

      (1, 2, 3, 6, 9)

  Write a program that reads numbers N from standard input, one per line,
  and outputs a minimal addition chain like the one above.

  Sometimes there will be several possible solutions of minimal length.
  That's fine; just pick one of them.
