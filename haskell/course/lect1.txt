Imperative languages
 - You tell HOW to solve a problem
 - For controlling performance
 - Has side effects, and it may be undesired.
 - Sequence of steps to execute
Declarative lanugages
 - Lisp, OCAML, Haskel
 - Prototyping
 - You only describe the problem, and we do not tell how to solve the problem.

Haskell:
- Does not require () paranthesis, and it is optional.
- No loops, if you want to repeat some stuff then use recursion.
- Polymorphic type system.
  length :: [a] -> Int    This is called as parametric polymorphism.
- There are no side effects. Evaluation of the same arguments yield in same result. This is called referential transperancy.
- Automatic memory management (If state is not stored then do we need garbage collector?)
- Higher order functions. Its like any other objects, and functions can be passed around as input or result.
- Lazy evaluation.Does as little work as possible, evaluates functions only when they are needed. This is not avaialble in all functional languages.
  Advantages:
  - Programs are shorter and clearer.
  - Less bugs during programming.
 

 Finding the list length in haskell:
 - If the list L is empty, then length(L) = 0
 - If the list L is not empty, and if XS is the list L without its first element then length(L) = 1 + length(XS)
  Example:
  "X:XS" means the list which results from the list XS by inserting the element X in front
  12:[70] = [12,70]
  15:(70:[])
  
  length :: [Int] -> Int
  length [] = 0
  length (x:xs) = 1 + length(xs)
