Chapter 1: Introduction
========================
* Haskell is declarative language. Unlike imperative language you just tell what it is and not what to do.
* There are no states and function has no side effects.
* In haskel, we can think programs as series of transformations on data.
* Haskell is statically typed.


Chapter 2: Starting out
========================
* Two types of functions are available. They are infix function and prefix function.
* Function application - Calling a function with parameters. Spaces are used for function application, and not brackets.
* IF statement is an expression and it MUST always contain ELSE statement. Because else is mandatory the IF statement will always return a value.
  For e.g. doubleSmallNumber x = if x > 100
                                  then x 
                                  else x * 2
* When a function does not take any parameters we say it is a definition (or a name). We cannot change the name.
  For e.g. funcDef = "Hello, Haskell"
* Lists are homogenous in Haskell.
